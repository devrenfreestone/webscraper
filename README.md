# webscraper

The purpose of this webscraper is to pull articles, images, titles, etc. off caranddriver.com (one of my favorite websites) and then display it for all users. Anyone should be able to comment or delete comments, and the comments should be specific to each article. It uses Mongo and Mongoose to store the data, and handlebars to display the front end.
